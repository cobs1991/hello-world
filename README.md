# hello-world
My first repository, for the first steps into learning to code.

I am first trying to learn HTML and CSS to a solid standard, before moving on to Javascript and other areas of code.

I will look into what area of coding I wish to specialise in after I have gained knowledge of the basics.

Eventually I will be able to tackle any coding challenges that I may come across.
